# Dominator algorithms

Include the following commonly used dominator algorithms:

1. Purdom algorithm
2. Iterative algorithm
3. Cooper algorithm
4. Tarjan algorithm (both simple and sophisticated, only in `cl-dominator-old.lisp` right now)
5. TODO Semi-NCA algorithm

**Warning**: Just for learning, not intended as a library. I won't maintain it.
